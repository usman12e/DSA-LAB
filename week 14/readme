Search Algorithms
ðŸ”¹ Sequential (Linear) Search:

Goes through the array one element at a time.

Works on unsorted arrays.

Tracks how many comparisons were made.

Simple but inefficient for large arrays.

ðŸ”¹ Binary Search:

Requires the array to be sorted first.

Divides the search space in half each time (divide-and-conquer approach).

Much faster than sequential search for large data sets.

Also tracks comparisons made.
