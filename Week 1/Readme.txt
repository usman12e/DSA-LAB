Templates in C++ enable the creation of generic, reusable functions and classes.
They allow working with different data types and sizes, increasing code flexibility and type safety.
A single implementation can handle multiple types and scenarios without duplication.
Demonstrates function overloading with templates.
Utilizes class member functions in template classes.
Handles arrays or structures with parameterized sizes using templates.
Uses conditional expressions (like the ternary operator) within template functions.
Helps write modular, efficient, and adaptable code
