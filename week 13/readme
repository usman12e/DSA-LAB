Sorting Algorithms
🔹 Bubble Sort:

Compares each pair and swaps if out of order.

Stops early if no swaps are made in a pass.

Tracks number of comparisons and exchanges.

🔹 Insertion Sort:

Builds the sorted array one element at a time.

Shifts larger elements to the right to insert the current element in place.

Also tracks comparisons and exchanges.

🔹 Selection Sort:

Finds the smallest element and places it at the start.

Repeats for the rest of the array.

Uses a minimum index (key) and swaps only once per pass.

Tracks comparisons and exchanges.

🧮 Performance Metrics
🔹 comparison counter: Counts how many comparisons were made during sorting.

🔹 exchange counter: Counts how many times elements were swapped or shifted.

⏱️ Measuring Time
🔹 Uses time_t and difftime() to measure how long a user takes to type their name.

🔹 Demonstrates how to calculate and display elapsed time.

📦 Memory Management
🔹 Uses new to dynamically allocate an array based on user input.

🔹 Uses delete[] to free the memory afterward.

🖥️ User Interaction
🔹 Takes user input to define array size and values.

🔹 Asks for user's name and calculates typing time.
