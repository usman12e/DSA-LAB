Definition of Queue

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

Queue Operations

Basic operations include:

enqueue(x) – insert at the rear

dequeue() – remove from the front

isEmpty(), isFull(), peek()

Array Implementation

You used a fixed-size array to implement the queue with front and rear pointers.

Circular Queue Concept (if applied)

If implemented circularly, you learned to wrap indices around the array when the end is reached.

Underflow and Overflow Conditions

Underflow: trying to dequeue when the queue is empty.

Overflow: trying to enqueue when the queue is full
