Linked List Basics

Learned how to create and manage a singly linked list using dynamic memory allocation (new, delete).

Templates in C++

You used template<class ItemType> to create a generic list class that works with any data type (e.g., int, char).

Class Design

You practiced creating classes with private/protected members, public interfaces, and destructors for memory cleanup.
