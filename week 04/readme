What a Deque Is

A Deque (Double Ended Queue) allows insertion and deletion from both ends: left and right.

Circular Array Logic

Youâ€™ve implemented the deque using a circular array, managing the left and right pointers to wrap around when necessary.

Overflow and Underflow Conditions

You check for overflow when the deque is full and underflow when it's empty.

Dynamic Memory Allocation

You dynamically allocate memory for the deque using new and deallocate using delete[] in the destructor.

Template Programming

The class is generic using templates (template <typename T>), so it works for any data type
