 Recursion Basics – Functions calling themselves to solve smaller subproblems.
 Factorial Using Recursion – fact(n) = n * fact(n - 1), base case: fact(0) = 1.
 Reverse Input Characters – Uses recursion to reverse input without extra storage.
 Power Function Recursively – Computes X^N with base case power(X, 0) = 1.
 Ackermann Function – Example of deep recursion, grows very fast.
 Binomial Coefficient Calculation – Uses Pascal’s triangle formula recursively.
 Check If a Number is Prime – Recursively divides n by increasing values.
 Printing Numbers in Reverse – Recursively prints numbers from n to 1.
